## Project: Predicting Boston Housing Prices

## Project Overview
In this project, I applied supervised machine learning concepts and techniques on data collected for housing prices in the Boston, Massachusetts area to predict the selling price of a new home.I explored the data to obtain important features and descriptive statistics about the dataset, then splitted the data into testing and training subsets, and decided the most suitable performance metric for this problem, and finally built a fairly performed model for this problem.

## Skills Used
- NumPy to investigate the latent features of a dataset.
- Analyze various learning performance plots for variance and bias.
- Determine the best-guess model for predictions from unseen data.
- Evaluate a model's performance on unseen data using previous data.

## Software and Libraries
