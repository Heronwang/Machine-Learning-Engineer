## Project: Finding Donors for CharityML

## Project Overview
In this project, I applied supervised learning techniques and an analytical mind on data collected for the U.S. census to help CharityML (a fictitious charity organization) identify people most likely to donate to their cause. I first explored the data to learn how the census data is recorded. Next, I applied a series of transformations and preprocessing techniques to manipulate the data into a workable format. I then evaluated several supervised learners on the data, and  picked best suited for the solution. Afterwards,  optimized the model as the solution to CharityML. Finally, I explored the chosen model and its predictions under the hood, and I found it performed quite well considering the data it's given.

## Skills Used
- Identify when preprocessing is needed, and how to apply it.
- Establish a benchmark for a solution to the problem.
- Investigate whether a candidate solution model is adequate for the problem.
