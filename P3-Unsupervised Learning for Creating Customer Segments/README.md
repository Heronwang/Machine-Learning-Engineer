## Unsupervised Learning Project: Creating Customer Segments

## Project Overview
In this project I applied unsupervised learning techniques on product spending data collected for customers of a wholesale distributor in Lisbon, Portugal to identify customer segments hidden in the data. I first explored the data by selecting a small subset to sample and determine if any product categories highly correlate with one another. Afterwards, I preprocessd the data by scaling each product category and then identifying (and removing) unwanted outliers. With the good, clean customer spending data, I applied PCA transformations to the data and implement clustering algorithms to segment the transformed customer data. Finally, I compared the segmentation found with an additional labeling and consider ways this information could assist the wholesale distributor with future service changes.

## Skills Used
- Apply preprocessing techniques such as feature scaling and outlier detection.
- Interpret data points that have been scaled, transformed, or reduced from PCA.
- Analyze PCA dimensions and construct a new feature space.
- Optimally cluster a set of data to find hidden patterns in a dataset.
- Assess information given by cluster data and use it in a meaningful way.
