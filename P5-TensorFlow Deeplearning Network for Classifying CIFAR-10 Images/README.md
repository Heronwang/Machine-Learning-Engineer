## Deep Learning Project: Classifying CIFAR-10 Images

## Project Overview
In this project, I classified images from the CIFAR-10 dataset, which is consists of airplanes, dogs, cats, and other objects. I first preprocessed the images, then trained a convolutional neural network on all the samples. 
After that, I normalized the image features and one-hot encoded the labels. Finally, I applied the concepts and techniques I have learned to build a convolutional, max pooling, dropout, and fully connected layers. At the end, I checked and optimized the neural network's predictions on the sample images.
